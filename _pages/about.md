I am currently a Ph.D. student at ECE@Purdue. I am supervised by [Dr. James Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/). 
My research interest is Software Engineering for Machine Learning, especially the trustworthiness of Pre-trained Models.
I like learning cutting-edge technology, working on undiscovered knowledge, and contributing to society.
