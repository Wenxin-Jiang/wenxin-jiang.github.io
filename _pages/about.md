I am currently a Ph.D. ~~student~~ candidate (Dec, 2023) at ECE@Purdue. I am supervised by [Dr. James Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/).

My research interest is focused on <ins>SE4AI</ins>, and <ins>Responsible AI</ins>. I currently work on advancing AI **safety/security** and **utility**, more specifically on *improving reusability, trustworthiness, and security of pre-trained deep learning models (**PTM**s)* from model registries/hubs, such as Hugging Face.

Here is a list of projects that I am actively working on:
- _Trustworthiness_: Anomaly detection for PTM naming and architectural defects.
- _Reusability_: PTM recommendation system considering engineering requirements.
- _Security_: Defense against Pickle deserialization vulnerabilities in PTMs.

My work has been published at **MSR'24, ICSE'23, MSR'23, ESEC/FSE'22, ASE'22, and SCORED'22**.

I am also the leader of Purdue's [Pre-Trained Models in Deep Learning VIP team](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/tensorflow) (previously [TensorFlow Model Garden VIP team](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/pretrained-models-in-deep-learning) where we collaborated with Google).
