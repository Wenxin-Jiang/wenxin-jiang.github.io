I am currently a Ph.D. ~~student~~ candidate (Dec, 2023) at ECE@Purdue. I am supervised by [Dr. James Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/).

My research interest is mainly focused on **Software engineering for AI (SE4AI)**. I am also interested in studying *machine learning systems*, *software supply chain security*, and *responsible AI*.

My work adapts methods from studies on traditional software package registries (e.g., NPM, PyPI) to **open-source pre-trained AI model (PTM) supply chain**. I currently work on developing novel approaches to enhancing multiple aspects of the PTM supply chain , including <ins>trustworthiness, reusability, and security<ins>.

Here is a list of projects that I am actively working on:
- _Trustworthiness_: Anomaly detection for PTM naming and architectural defects.
- _Reusability_: PTM recommendation system considering engineering requirements.
- _Security_: Defense against Pickle deserialization vulnerabilities in PTMs.

My work has been published at **MSR'24, ICSE'23, MSR'23, ESEC/FSE'22, ASE'22, and SCORED'22**.

I am also the leader of Purdue's [Pre-Trained Models in Deep Learning VIP team](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/tensorflow) (previously [TensorFlow Model Garden VIP team](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/pretrained-models-in-deep-learning) where we collaborated with Google).
