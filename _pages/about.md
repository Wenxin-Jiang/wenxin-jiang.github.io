I am currently a Ph.D. ~~student~~ candidate (Dec, 2023) at ECE@Purdue. I am supervised by [Dr. James Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/). 

My research focuses on advancing AI **safety** and **utility**, with a current emphasis on *improving reusability, trustworthiness, and security within pre-trained deep learning model ecosystems*.

My work has been published at **MSR'24, ICSE'23, MSR'23, ESEC/FSE'22, ASE'22, and SCORED'22**.

I am also the leader of Purdue's [Pre-Trained Models in Deep Learning VIP team](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/tensorflow) (previously [TensorFlow Model Garden VIP team](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP/teams/pretrained-models-in-deep-learning) where we collaborated with Google).
