Hi, I'm Wenxin Jiang!
I am currently a Ph.D. student at ECE@Purdue. I am supervised by [Dr. James Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/). 
My research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning.
I like learning cutting-edge technology, working on undiscovered knowledge, and contributing to society.
